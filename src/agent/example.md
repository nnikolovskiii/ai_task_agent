# Work Management System Overview

## Purpose
This system provides a structured approach to organize and track work-related tasks, goals, and progress.

## How to Use This System

### Daily Workflow
1. Review `tasks.md` for active tasks
2. Update task statuses as needed
3. Add new tasks as they arise
4. Move completed tasks to `finished_task.md`

### Weekly Review
1. Review all active tasks
2. Update priorities based on current needs
3. Check progress against goals in `goals.md`
4. Identify any blocked or pending tasks that need attention

### Monthly Planning
1. Review completed tasks in `finished_task.md`
2. Assess progress on goals
3. Update goals as needed
4. Plan next month's priorities

## File Structure
- **tasks.md**: Active tasks (new, in-progress, pending)
- **finished_task.md**: Completed tasks with completion dates
- **goals.md**: Short, medium, and long-term objectives
- **details.md**: This overview document

## Task Status Definitions
- **New**: Task created but not started
- **In-Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Pending**: Waiting for dependencies or approval
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to external factors

## Recent Updates

### Chat Interface Improvements - Completed
- Redesigned the chat interface to enhance its visual appeal and usability
- The new design is a significant improvement over the previous version
- Minor refinements may still be needed

### Next Steps Identified
1. **Message Management for the Model**
   - Currently, all messages are sent to the model, but only some are necessary
   - Need to implement a system to filter or prioritize relevant messages
   - Possible approaches: iterative processing or modular yet simple architecture

2. **Expanding Data Source Connections**
   - The system currently connects to a single source but should integrate with multiple sources
   - Key considerations: how monitoring gaps align with research topics and best practices for multi-source integration
   - Next action: Discuss with manager to determine the optimal implementation strategy
